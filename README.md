# Awake
With this simple menubar app you can make your Mac stay awake in one click. Just click the eye icon ![Closed Eye](Awake/Assets.xcassets/EyeClosed.imageset/Eye-closed@1x.png) in the menubar and now your Mac won't go into the sleep mode. The icon will change to open eye: ![Eye icon](Awake/Assets.xcassets/EyeOpen.imageset/Eye-open@1x.png)

By default it will stay in the Awake mode until you manually turn it off. However, you can right-click the menubar icon and choose a time interval to turn the Awake mode off automatically.
